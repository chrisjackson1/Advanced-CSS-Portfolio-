            <p>My Name is Chris Jackson, and I am an aspiring web developer.
                I was born in Brooklyn, New York, but grew up in a small town called Hillsdale New Jersey.
                I attended Rutgers University in 2016 and graduated in the winter of 2019 with a degree in Information
                Technology and a minor in Sociology. My passions and hobbies include, working out, making beats, playing
                basketball and Djing. Here are some projects/works that I've done on this page.

            <p>Here's a project that I worked on with other collegues in the bootcamp..</p>
            <p>A Star Wars Travel Planner that allows you to find information on planets/people/spaceships with the weather included.
                I designed the front-end by uploading images on our web page, hard coding in cards, and illustrating different locations that you can visit.</p>

                height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
            <p>For this Demo I built a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database,
                using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.</p>

            <p>Here's a project that I worked on with other collegues in the bootcamp..</p>
            <p>This application is a Pizza ordering app where users can sign up or login to place an order while the employee receives those orders. This application was created to allow users to place an order online from wherever they are without having to call the restaurant or waiting in the store.  It also helps the employer to gain more customers providing them with more orders to add to their in store orders. </p>
