# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio-
Building CSS Portfolio from Scratch



## Description

Our challenge for this assignment was to create CSS and HTML code from scratch to build a profile for potential recruiters to look at. Detailing things such as our name, profile picture, information about us, contact information, along with assignments and projects that we've done show casing our skills.

### HTML

The syntax used in the HTML was:

    - The code from our first homework. I used some of the code from my first assignment to help lay the groundwork to create my website from scratch.
    - Used the same format from my first homework, and implemented it into the HTML.
    - But I did have to change around some of the section id's, class, and div's. Had to change names for each one to fit the criteria for this new assignment.

CSS

The syntax used in the CSS file was:

    - The code from our first homework, I used some of the code from my first assignment to help lay the groundwork to create my website from scratch.
    - Used the same format from my first homework, and implemented it into the CSS.
    - For the CSS section, I had to research new CSS selectors. For example the picture grid.
